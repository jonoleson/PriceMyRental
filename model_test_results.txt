**Benchmark**
Method:
-Get median 1 bedroom values in each neighborhood, add this as a feature
-User Random Forest Regressor to predict price based on existing numerical features

Results:
R^2: 0.730
RMSE: 973.441

**Benchmark + NMF**
Method:
-On top of benchmark method, add latent features weights derived from the description text 
-Use Random Forest Regressor to predict price based on these existing numerical features as well as the latent feature weights

Results:
R^2: 0.807
RMSE: 805.004

**Nearest Neighbors**
Method: 
-Used a KD-Tree to find the nearest 20 neighbors to the each listing, then take the median of those listings

Results:
RMSE: 934.988 with k=20, 883.820 with k=10,
