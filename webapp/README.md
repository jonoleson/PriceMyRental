To try the app, go to [PriceMyRental.io](http://pricemyrental.io). I recommend testing using [listings from this popular classifieds site](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/sfc/apa)

Question: How might one break this app?

Answer: So many ways! For now. 
Basically, for the app to work in its current iteration, you need to:
1. Fill out every field in the form
2. Enter parameters for bedrooms and bathrooms that realistically exist (I recommend just testing it with real listings). If you try to find the price of a place with 5 beds and only 1 bath, it will probably break.
